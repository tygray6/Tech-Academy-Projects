                    <h2>As a commuter</h2>

                    A couple months ago, I suffered the commuter's nightmare: my bike was stolen.  Being a bikeophile really
                    salvaged the situation- I used the Blackbuck.  For twenty bucks, I got it up and running for commuting duties
                    and it has been great.

                    Fortune smiles on hoarders sometimes- I've been sitting on my 29er commuting kit for a year and right before
                    I was about to sell it, this emergency came up.  Because the bike has no eyelets, I bought a pair of Axiom Fender
                    Runners and I was good to go.

                    <h2>As a mountain bike</h2>

                    It is a great mountain bike- pretty, compliant and room for a variety of tires.  As a SS bike, one can't ask
                    for much more.  I did end up bying a headst to slack out the headangle by a degree, which has slowed down the
                    steering to a comfortable level.

                    It climbs really well, which was surprising because of the chainstays- I expected worse, but so far, it is
                    a perfect SS.  The only gripe I have at this juncture is that on tight twisties the back end is slow to whip around
                    and requires some body english.
